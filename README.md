INRC Ecosystem
==============

This repository will host models, modules, algorithms and applications developed by the INRC Community using nxsdk to run on the Intel Loihi Platform.

The repository is structured into directories. nxsdk_modules_ncl directory will be used to publish code/models which have been developed by maintainers of this repo. Researchers can publish and collaborate by publishing code/models within the nxsdk_modules_contrib directory. All code submissions will be reviewed. Please use the Github PR process. All contributed code will be distributed under the LICENSE provided with this repository.

To run the models, access to the Loihi software development kit (NxSDK) and the Loihi hardware is needed.
